			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring speculation and housing for the rich</h2>

			<h3>Initial Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Question 1: How has the distribution of residential sales in changed over time in terms of type of buyer?
					
					Motivation:
					This question was motivated by the article "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord." 
					In this article it mentioned how in San Francisco the share of apartments where individuals were 
					landlords continued to drop as corporate players bought up these spaces and rented them out with the sole concern for profit as opposed to resident comfortability and safety.
					I wanted to see if the pattern with investors has gotten worse or better in Boston and learn about the which types of buyers are changing. 
					I was curious to know what type of buyers are investing more in houses and which ones have less to invest? 

				</li>
				<li>Question 2: What are factors contribute to the properties that have been flipped in the past five years?

					Motivation: The motivation behind this question is that knowing which type of properties are being flipped can help to understand why they are being flipped.
					This might cause sellers of these properties (particularly individuals) to be more selective when choosing buyers to sell to, especially if their property is likely to be flipped.
					This question was also motivated by the "Homes for Profit" article where they talked about buyers evicting current tenants of the property in order to flip it.
					This was especially concerning because these units under the portfolio were income-restricted and most were reserved for those who are making less than 60% of the area's median level of income.
					Displacing such people would make it very hard for them to find new affordable housing on such a short notice, so understanding what might motivate investors to flip properties can help us fight it and continue to provide affordable housing to those who need it.
				</li>
				<li>Question 3: Is there any association between price difference between flips and the type of seller vs type of buyer?

					Motivation: The motivation behind this question is to see if individuals are making less than investors when the house is a flip.
					This can also help pinpoint who is on the other end of the flip and who is either benefitting or underpaying? 
					If, for example, the seller of the properties are individuals and the buyers are large corporations, the individuals might derive more value from selling their property at a much higher price if the corporation is just going to flip the property and profit off of it.
					This way corporations and private equity firms are less likely to buy these properties and flip them, which can allow current tenants to keep their current housing since the corporation will no longer be upcharging them with reduced quality.
					Additionally, being aware of the type of buyer might allow the seller to be more aware of the price they are choosing, and the same is true for individuals when they buy from corporations.
				</li>
				<li>Question 4: How do the residential areas differ by zipcode?

					Motivation: Understanding how residential areas vary across zipcodes can help us understand what types of neighborhoods are targeted by bigger companies.
					These could be related to the type of house in those neighborhoods, when the house was made, or if the neighborhood is in a central area that might be close to public transport.
					Understanding the difference between these areas and whether one area is targeted more than the others can help prevent such targetting in the future by fixing the issues that are correlated with these areas becoming targets.

			<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>

			<p> This dataset contains a sample of 49,300 residential sales transactiondata in the City of Boston for propperties sold between 2000 and 2022.
				Each of the datapoints has 63 variables describing qualities such as location, whether or property was flipped, the property type, price, and who the buyers and sellers were.
				This data was acquired from a partner of the 6.C85 course, MAPC, who purchasede this data from The Warren Group, which includes all residential property transactions in the MAPC region from 2000 through 2024.
				A property is considered to have been "flipped" if it has been sold within 2 years of its most recent purchase date, with a few exceptions such as sales by banks, or government related agencies and the home was foreclosed.
				We begin our data exploration by studying individual variables, their distributions, and addressing data quality issues. 
				As we continue to explore the data we take a look at multivariate plots and their relationship to our questions.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
				We first look at our data set overall to see if we notice any major patterns. 
				This chart shows the number of residential sales transactions that occurred for each year between 2000 and 2022. 
				We observe that there is a slight peak in sales transactions in 2004 with some higher sales in the years surrounding it, however outside of this peak, the sales transactions seem to fluctuate pretty arbitrarily around 2000 transactions per year.
				This peak likely exists due to the low interests rates, variety of loans available, and buying frenzy due to the low rates during that year. 
				However, this bubble eventually burst in 2008 which caused interest rates to increase and the total sales transactions went down.
				We do notice there are particularly low sales transactions in 2009 and 2020. This is likely due to the economic recessions in the US during those years.
				In 2008 the economic recession was caused by the burst of the housing bubble which likely made people less willing to buy houses and therefore resulted in fewer transactions in 2009.
				In 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and caused many people to lose stable sources of income and overall spend less. As a result, people were less likely to buy properties due to a lack of spendable money in the economy.

				<figcaption>
				Since whether or not a transaction was flipped is a crucial measure in a lot of our analysis questions, we next look at if there is a relation between the year and how mnay transactions were flipped.
				From the graph above, we observe that the number of flipped transactions increases dramatically starting in 2010.
				It goes from essentially no flipped transactions to 180 flipped transactions by 2014.
				This continues in a sharp increase until 2014, after which the number of flipped transactions appears to go down slightly to around 100-110 transactions.
				This mankes sense that a lot of transactions which were flipped occured in 2010 because of the Housing crisis of 2008. 
				Many people could not afford the mortgage loan and as a result had to sell their accomodation at a low price.
				By 2014 the housing market had somewhat recovered from the housing crisis, which is why the flipped transaction numbers started to go down again.

				<img src="AllBuyer.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
				This graph looks into the distribution of buyer type by year in order to answer our first question. 
				From this graph we can see that the buyers who are purchasing the greatest total value of houses are characterized primarily as non-value investors as seen by the turquoise green blue coloring.
				However, this does not mean that institutional or large investors are not increasing the amount of properties they are buying.
				This brings us to a follow up question of whether the number of properties the bought by instutions and large investors are increasing.

			<figure>
				<img src="BuyerType.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
				This graph looks into answering the previous follow up question with a closer look into the institutional and large buyers purchasing patterns.
				From this graph, we can see that there is indeed a sharp increase in the purchase value of the transactions of instutions in the year 2019. 
				This is the same year which the pandemic occured in, so there might be some correlation in people having to leave their apartments because they are unable to afford them, similar to Titus in Mousbe in "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord" article.
				This could have allowed larger institutions to buy these apartments at a lower price than before, whereas regular individuals no longer had the salary to afford these purchases.
				We also notice a slight upward increase in the purchase value of large investors, while the total value of purchases fluctuates around the same number.
				This suggests that more and more of the purchases are from large buyers and institutions as opposed to other types of buyers which are slowly decreasing.
