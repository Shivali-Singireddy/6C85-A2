			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring speculation and housing for the rich</h2>

			<h3>Initial Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Question 1: How has the distribution of residential sales in changed over time in terms of type of buyer?
					
					Motivation:
					This question was motivated by the article "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord." 
					In this article it mentioned how in San Francisco how the share of apartments where individuals were 
					landlords continued to drop as corporate players bought up these spaces and rented them out with the sole concern for profit as opposed to resident comfortability and safety.
					I wanted to see if the pattern with investors has gotten worse or better in Boston and learn about the which types of buyers are changing. 
					I was cruious to know what type of buyers are investing more in houses and which ones have less to invest? 

				</li>
				<li>Question 2: What are factors contribute to the properties that have been flipped in the past five years?

					Motivation: The motivation behind this question is that knowing which type of properties are being flipped can help to understand why they are being flipped.
					This might cause sellers of these properties (particularly individuals) to be more selective when choosing buyers to sell to, especially if their property is likeliy to be flipped.
					This question was also motivated by the "Homes for Profit" article where they talked about buyers evicting current tenants of the property in order to flip it.
					This was especially pressing because these units under the portfolio were income-restricted and most were reserved for those who are making less than 60% of the area's median level of income.
					Displacing such people would make it very hard for them to find new affordable housing on such a short notice, so understanding what might motivate investors to flip properties can help us fight it and continue to provide affordable housing to those who need it.
				</li>
				<li>Question 3: Is there any association between price difference between flips and the type of seller vs type of buyer?

					Motivation: The motivation behind this question is to see if individuals are making less than investors when the house is a flip.
					This can also help pinpoint who is on the other end of the flip and who is either benefitting or underpaying? 
					If, for example, the seller of the properties are individuals and the buyers are large corporations, the individuals might derive more value from selling their property at a much higher price if the corporation is just going to flip the property and profit off of it.
					This way corporations and private equity firms are less likely to buy these properties and flip them, which can allow current tenants to keep their current housing.
					Additionally, being aware of the type of buyer might allow the seller to be more aware of the price they are choosing, and the same is true for individuals when they buy from corporations.
				</li>
				<li>Question 4: How do the residential areas differ by zipcode?

					Motivation: Understanding how residential areas vary across zipcodes can help us understand what types of neighborhoods are targeted by bigger companies.
					These could be related to the type of house in those neighborhoods, when the house was made, or if the neighborhood is in a central area that might be close to public transport.
					Understanding the difference between these areas and whether one area is targeted more than the others can help prevent such targetting in the future by fixing the issues that are correlated with these areas becoming targets.
