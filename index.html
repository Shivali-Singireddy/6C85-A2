			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring speculation and housing for the rich</h2>

			<h3>Initial Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Question 1: How has the distribution of residential sales in changed over time in terms of type of buyer?
					
					Motivation:
					This question was motivated by the article "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord." 
					In this article it mentioned how in San Francisco how the share of apartments where individuals were 
					landlords continued to drop as corporate players bought up these spaces and rented them out with the sole concern for profit as opposed to resident comfortability and safety.
					I wanted to see if the pattern with investors has gotten worse or better in Boston and learn about the which types of buyers are changing. 
					I was cruious to know what type of buyers are investing more in houses and which ones have less to invest? 

				</li>
				<li> Is there any association between the type of properties that have been flipped in the past five years?


					Motivation: Which type of properties are being flipped can help to understand why they are being flipped and maybe cause sellers to be more selective when choosing buyers who to sell them to if they are just going to be flipped in a year
				</li>
				<li>Is there any association between price difference between flips and the type of seller vs type of buyer?

					Motivation: See if individuals are making less than investors when the house is a flip and who is on the other end of the flip who is either benefitting or underpaying
				</li>
