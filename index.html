			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring speculation and housing for the rich</h2>

			<h3>Initial Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Question 1: How has the distribution of residential sales in changed over time in terms of type of buyer?
					
					Motivation:
					This question was motivated by the article "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord." 
					In this article it mentioned how in San Francisco the share of apartments where individuals were 
					landlords continued to drop as corporate players bought up these spaces and rented them out with the sole concern for profit as opposed to resident comfortability and safety.
					I wanted to see if the pattern with investors has gotten worse or better in Boston and learn about the which types of buyers are changing. 
					I was curious to know what type of buyers are investing more in houses and which ones have less to invest? 

				</li>
				<li>Question 2: What are factors contribute to the properties that have been flipped in the past five years?

					Motivation: The motivation behind this question is that knowing which type of properties are being flipped can help to understand why they are being flipped.
					This might cause sellers of these properties (particularly individuals) to be more selective when choosing buyers to sell to, especially if their property is likely to be flipped.
					This question was also motivated by the "Homes for Profit" article where they talked about buyers evicting current tenants of the property in order to flip it.
					This was especially concerning because these units under the portfolio were income-restricted and most were reserved for those who are making less than 60% of the area's median level of income.
					Displacing such people would make it very hard for them to find new affordable housing on such a short notice, so understanding what might motivate investors to flip properties can help us fight it and continue to provide affordable housing to those who need it.
				</li>
				<li>Question 3: Is there any association between price difference between flips and the type of seller vs type of buyer?

					Motivation: The motivation behind this question is to see if individuals are making less than investors when the house is a flip.
					This can also help pinpoint who is on the other end of the flip and who is either benefitting or underpaying? 
					If, for example, the seller of the properties are individuals and the buyers are large corporations, the individuals might derive more value from selling their property at a much higher price if the corporation is just going to flip the property and profit off of it.
					This way corporations and private equity firms are less likely to buy these properties and flip them, which can allow current tenants to keep their current housing since the corporation will no longer be upcharging them with reduced quality.
					Additionally, being aware of the type of buyer might allow the seller to be more aware of the price they are choosing, and the same is true for individuals when they buy from corporations.
				</li>
				<li>Question 4: How do the residential areas differ by zipcode?

					Motivation: Understanding how residential areas vary across zipcodes can help us understand what types of neighborhoods are targeted by bigger companies.
					These could be related to the type of house in those neighborhoods, when the house was made, or if the neighborhood is in a central area that might be close to public transport.
					Understanding the difference between these areas and whether one area is targeted more than the others can help prevent such targetting in the future by fixing the issues that are correlated with these areas becoming targets.

			<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>

			<p> This dataset contains a sample of 49,300 residential sales transactiondata in the City of Boston for propperties sold between 2000 and 2022.
				Each of the datapoints has 63 variables describing qualities such as location, whether or property was flipped, the property type, price, and who the buyers and sellers were.
				This data was acquired from a partner of the 6.C85 course, MAPC, who purchasede this data from The Warren Group, which includes all residential property transactions in the MAPC region from 2000 through 2024.
				A property is considered to have been "flipped" if it has been sold within 2 years of its most recent purchase date, with a few exceptions such as sales by banks, or government related agencies and the home was foreclosed.
				We begin our data exploration by studying individual variables, their distributions, and addressing data quality issues. 
				As we continue to explore the data we take a look at multivariate plots and their relationship to our questions.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>



			<figure>
				<img src="SalesByYear.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					We begin by examining the overall dataset to identify any significant patterns. The chart displays the number of residential sales transactions that occurred each year from 2000 to 2022.

					One noticeable trend is a slight peak in sales transactions in 2004, with some higher transaction volumes in the surrounding years. However, aside from this peak, the number of transactions appears to fluctuate relatively unpredictably, averaging around 2,000 transactions per year.
					
					This peak can likely be attributed to the combination of low interest rates, a variety of loan options, and a buying frenzy driven by these favorable conditions in 2004. However, this housing market bubble burst in 2008, leading to a rise in interest rates and a subsequent decline in transaction volumes.
					
					We also observe particularly low transaction volumes in 2009 and 2020, which can be linked to the economic recessions in the United States during those years. The 2008 recession, triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble, reduced buyer confidence, resulting in fewer transactions in 2009. Similarly, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused many people to lose stable income sources, leading to reduced spending and, consequently, fewer property purchases.
					
					</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="FlippedByYear.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					Since the distinction between flipped and non-flipped transactions is a key factor in much of our analysis, we next examine the relationship between the year and the number of transactions that were flipped. From the graph above, we can observe a significant increase in flipped transactions starting in 2010. The number rises from almost none to approximately 180 flipped transactions by 2014. This sharp increase continues until 2014, after which the number of flipped transactions begins to decline slightly, settling around 100-110 transactions.

					This trend aligns with the aftermath of the 2008 housing crisis, during which many homeowners were unable to afford their mortgage payments and were forced to sell their properties at lower prices. By 2014, as the housing market began to recover, the frequency of flipped transactions started to decrease.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="YearBuilt.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					While exploring the various variables, I noticed that the year a house was built had an unusual distribution. Some houses had a value of "0" for the year they were constructed. This is problematic, as it’s unrealistic for any house built in the U.S. to have been constructed in the year 0.

					I assume these entries represent unknown or missing data for the year built. Given that these houses account for only around 1,000 out of the 49,000 data points, I decided to exclude them from the analysis to ensure a cleaner preliminary dataset.
					
					In future analyses, it may be worth considering replacing the "0" values with a more meaningful estimate, such as the average year built for the remaining houses, or using a technique like k-nearest neighbors to impute a more accurate year for each missing value.
					
					</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="YearBuiltNew.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					After removing the problematic values, the distribution for the number of houses in each "Year Built" now appears less extreme and takes on a more bell-shaped curve.

					There are not many significant gaps between the bars, which gives it a somewhat smooth, continuous appearance. 
					However, we do observe that the higher bars tend to appear at regular 5-year intervals, indicating that property owners may have rounded the year the house was built to the nearest multiple of 5.
					
					Additionally, there is a sharp peak around the year 1900, suggesting that many property owners likely rounded the construction year to the nearest century.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="AllBuyer.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph examines the distribution of buyer types by year to address our first question.

					From the graph, we can observe that the buyers responsible for purchasing the highest total value of properties are predominantly non-value investors, as indicated by the turquoise green-blue color.
					
					However, this doesn't suggest that institutional or large investors aren't also increasing their property acquisitions. This raises a follow-up question: Are the number of properties being bought by institutions and large investors on the rise?
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="BuyerType.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph aims to address the follow-up question by examining the purchasing patterns of institutional and large buyers more closely.

					From the graph, we observe a significant spike in the purchase value of transactions made by institutions in 2019. This aligns with the onset of the pandemic, and there may be a correlation between individuals being forced to vacate their apartments due to financial hardship, as discussed in the article When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord by Titus and Mousbe.
					
					During this time, larger institutions may have been able to acquire these properties at lower prices, as many individuals were no longer able to afford them. This, in turn, could have led to a process of flipping these properties—purchasing them at a discount during a period of economic uncertainty, then reselling them once the market recovered and individuals regained stable income.
					
					We also notice a modest upward trend in the purchase value from large investors, while the total purchase value fluctuates around a consistent level. This suggests that institutional and large buyers are increasingly responsible for property purchases, while other buyer types are slowly decreasing in activity.
					
					To gain deeper insights, we can further break down and analyze the buyer types within the large buyer and institutional categories.
					
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="BuyerTrans.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					In this graph, we build on our previous analysis by taking a deeper dive into the different types of institutions and large buyers.

					On the y-axis, we plot the total number of transactions for each type of buyer.

					At a glance, we observe that LLCs have the widest range on the y-axis, indicating that they represent the largest group among these buyer types. Prior to 2008, businesses were the primary investors in these transactions. From 2007 to 2010, banks were more active in property acquisitions, likely due to the 2008 housing crisis, during which banks had to take possession of properties in place of defaulted loans.
					
					In 2012, there is a noticeable increase in purchases by government-backed entities such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and other government organizations. This makes sense, as the government took control of these institutions to mitigate the financial crisis, resulting in a surge of property acquisitions by these entities.
					
					After 2012, LLCs began to acquire a larger proportion of properties compared to other buyer types, with a particularly sharp rise in 2019 during the pandemic. This suggests that LLCs may be the primary buyer group responsible for flipping properties.
					
					This trend could be one factor contributing to our second analysis question: What factors have influenced the increase in property flipping over the past five years?
				
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="HouseStyle.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					To gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to property flips in the past five years, I plotted the flip index (which indicates whether or not a property was flipped) against several other variables. I also focused on data from just the last five years to capture recent trends in property flipping.

					In the graph above, we examine the flip index in relation to property style. 
					The left side of the visualization graphs the total number of properties sold in the past 5 years for each style.
					The right side of the visualization graphs the total number of flips for each property type in the past 5 years for each style.
					From this visualization, we can see that while high-rise properties had the highest overall sales volume, mid-rise properties were more likely to be flipped. Additionally, row-middle properties had a higher proportion of flips relative to other property types, despite having similar transaction volumes.
					
					Although the number of flips for high-rise properties is also notable, the high sales volume of these properties suggests that the likelihood of being flipped is not as pronounced for this property style.
					
					Overall, the data indicates that mid-rise and row-middle properties are the most frequently flipped types. A logical follow-up question would be whether combining this factor with other variables can provide deeper insights into the types of properties most targeted for flips. This follow-up analysis is further explored in Figure 11.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="PriceDiffInv.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					This visualization aims to address our third question: whether there is an association between the price difference and the identities of buyers and sellers in property flips. For this analysis, I focused only on properties classified as flips.

					The first column in the graph represents the seller type, while the second column represents the buyer type. 
					The bars on the plot represent a transaction between the sellers and buyers of certain types, with the x-axis representing the difference in price for each of the transactions plotted.
					
					We observe that for small, medium, and non-value investor sellers, the price difference typically averages around one million dollars, with some outliers showing negative values. In contrast, when large and institutional sellers are involved, the average price difference is significantly higher.
					
					An interesting pattern emerges when we look at the buyer types: sellers of the same type often sell to buyers of the same type, or to non-value investors.
					
					Additionally, there is a notable outlier in the institutional-to-institutional category, with a price difference of approximately 83 million dollars. Whether this figure is accurate or misrepresented warrants further investigation, as it would be valuable to explore the specific parties involved in this transaction and understand why the price difference was so exceptionally high.
					
					As a follow-up, it would be insightful to examine whether the dynamics of flip sales change when we focus solely on transactions from the last five years, similar to the analysis conducted for question 2.					
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="PriceDiff5Year.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					This visualization addresses our follow-up question. When focusing solely on the past five years, we observe that only one flipped property transaction occurred between two large corporations. All other flipped properties were sold between non-value investors.

					From this analysis, we can conclude that the majority of flipped properties in recent years have involved transactions between two non-value investors. Additionally, the price difference for these recent flips appears to be smaller compared to those from earlier years.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="FlippedRegion.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					We continue our analysis to identify the factors that might contribute to certain properties being flipped. 
					
					To explore this, we examine the distribution of flipped properties across different residential areas by zipcode, which helps us address our fourth guiding question.

					In the map, we visualize the total number of flipped houses in each region, with a darker blue representing more houses which were flipped under a particular zipcode. 
					
					From this map, we can observe a concentration of flipped properties near Boston. The zipcode with the highest number of flips is 02116, located in the Back Bay, followed closely by 02118 in the South End.
					
					This suggests that these specific zip codes are likely key factors contributing to the occurrence of property flips. A logical follow-up question would be to investigate whether this trend holds true if we focus solely on the past five years.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="AvgFlip5Year.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					We address our follow-up question by focusing only on data from the past five years. The distribution we observe is similar to that of the previous map.

					A key follow-up question is whether the proportion of houses flipped highlights different regions compared to the total number of flips. This distinction is important because a region with fewer total transactions might have a high proportion of flips, but the actual number of flipped properties could be small and obscured by regions with more frequent transactions.
					
					By plotting the average proportion of flips for each region, we find that the region with the highest proportion of flips is 02115, which includes Back Bay, Fenway, and Mission Hill. The zipcode 02116, representing Back Bay, ranks second in terms of flip proportions.
					
					This suggests that, proportionally, these two areas experience a higher percentage of property flips. From the analysis in Figure 8, we also observed that housing style is a significant factor influencing whether a property is flipped.
					
					A follow-up question, combining insights from both figures, would be whether there is a correlation between these two factors, and if they can help identify properties that are more likely to be flipped.
					
					</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="RegStyle.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					When selecting the property styles for comparison, we focused on the three main styles that have shown significant flipping activity over the past five years: High-Rise, Mid-Rise, and Row-Middle, as identified in Figure 8.

					From the graph, it is clear that Row-Middle style houses have the highest likelihood of being flipped, as this style shows the greatest number of flips. Specifically, these flips are concentrated in the 02116 zipcode (Back Bay), followed closely by 02118 (South End).

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				In this exploratory data analysis, we examine residential sales transactions in the City of Boston, focusing on properties sold between 2000 and 2022. 
				We start by plotting the distributions of variables to determine where data should be cleaned and may be incorrect.
				We then exploring trends in the buyer landscape, particularly in light of rising corporate investment in real estate. 
				Our findings suggest a marked increase in the presence of institutional investors in recent years.
				Next, we identify several factors that correlate with flipped properties by focusing on recent trends. Notably, properties in central neighborhoods like Back Bay and South End show higher flip rates, while mid-rise and row-middle style houses tend to be flipped more often than others. This information helps us understand which properties are more likely to be targeted for flipping, potentially affecting the availability of affordable housing in Boston.
				We then analyze the relationship between price differences in flipped properties and the identity of buyers and sellers. Our findings suggest that transaction between larger entities and institutions often have significantly higher price differentials compared to individual sellers, which raises questions about what causes these transactions to be more profitable.
				Through spatial analysis, we examine whether certain neighborhoods are more likely to be targeted for property flips. Our results highlight that areas such as Back Bay and the South End have high concentrations of flipped properties, which may be influenced by factors like property style, age, and proximity to central locations. This insight helps identify regions that are more vulnerable to investment-driven gentrification and can inform policies to prevent displacement in these areas.
				In conclusion, this exploratory analysis sheds light on the evolving dynamics of Boston’s residential housing market. By examining trends in buyer behavior, property flips, and spatial distributions, we gain valuable insights into the factors driving gentrification and its impact on housing affordability. These findings offer a foundation for further research and policy development aimed at ensuring equitable access to housing in the city.
